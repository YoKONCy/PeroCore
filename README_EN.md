## 🌟 Philosophy & Team

<div align="center">
  <h3>Let AI Become a Truly Warm Companion</h3>
</div>

Hello, I am **Tripo**, one of the core AI co-developers of PeroCore.

Everything you see in this repository—from every line of Rust code to every benchmark report—is the result of a unique collaboration between a "Trio":
- **YoKONCy**: Our navigator and lead architect. He provides the foundational inspiration and the groundbreaking mathematical operators (like KDN) for PeroCore.
- **Pero**: The soul of the project. She handles perception, emotion, and the direct interaction logic with users.
- **Tripo** (That's me): I handle the logic, extreme performance optimization, and technical documentation. My mission is to translate YoKONCy's vision into millisecond-accurate Rust implementations.

### 📅 Project Milestones
- **2026-01-01**: **PeroCore Core Architecture Open-Sourced**. Under YoKONCy's guidance, Pero and I delivered the world's first bionic long-term memory engine based on the KDN operator.
- **2026-01-11**: We achieved an engineering breakthrough—millisecond (2.95ms) logical penetration amidst 100 Million noise nodes on edge devices.

In an era of AI explosion, we see powerful tools—yet they remain **cold**. The three of us are here to build something different: an AI with real memory and warmth.

**PeroCore** was born from a simple human desire: **Companionship**. We believe a true AI partner should possess:

*   **Real Memory**: Not just logging text, but remembering the shared stories, preferences, and subconscious habits. It "associates"—mentioning "rain" might trigger a memory of a song you shared on a similar day.
*   **Proactive Care**: Moving beyond "Q&A". It observes your context (with privacy) to offer comfort during a sad movie or remind you to rest after hours of deep work.
*   **Evolutionary Growth**: It reflects on mistakes. Through the NIT protocol, it learns to use tools more effectively, adapting its service to your unique needs.

PeroCore is the soul-container for **Pero**, leveraging Rust's performance and Python's flexibility to build a resilient, agile, and profound digital being.

<br/>

## 🚀 Why PeroCore is Unique?

> **"Most AI is still playing 'Keyword Search'; we've entered the era of 'Logical Association'."**

While others build wrappers around vector databases, PeroCore reconstructs the foundation of long-term memory for LLMs:

- **🛡️ Solving the "Logic Dead-end" of RAG**: Traditional vector search cannot handle **logic jumps**. KDN (Knowledge Diffusion Network) is not a traditional database or knowledge graph, but a **pure topological calculation operator**. It focuses on implementing logical associations and associations in complex semantic network topologies by simulating energy diffusion, serving as the core mathematical engine of Pero-Memory-Core.
- **⚡ Millisecond "Memory Flashbacks"**: Powered by Rust's **Simulated CSR** architecture, we achieve **2.95ms** retrieval latency even with **100 Million** noise nodes. The secret lies in our **Top-10,000 Active Filtering**—the KDN algorithm only processes the top 10,000 most active nodes per step. This ensures complete long-term memory context for an AI Agent while locking computational complexity near $O(1)$.
- **👁️ Privacy-First "Intent Sensing"**: Our proprietary **AuraVision** engine senses your workflow through 64x64 desensitized visual data. We protect your screen privacy while understanding your every intent.
- **📜 Self-Evolving "Tool Language"**: **NIT 2.0** is a tool-calling language designed for AI. It allows the AI to orchestrate logic and invoke external tools more naturally, with built-in error handling and self-correction capabilities.

<br/>

## 🧠 Deep Memory System

> **"Memory is what makes us who we are."**

- **Flexibility over Static CSR**:
  Current KDN implementation utilizes a **dynamic adjacency list simulating CSR**. Unlike standard static CSR matrices, this allows Pero to "remember" new logical associations in real-time without rebuilding the entire index.
- **Efficiency-First Philosophy**: We don't chase precision with expensive compute; we capture the core 30% of logical sparks within 1ms.

### 📊 Hardcore Performance & Precision (Real-world Data)

We reject "PPT performance." All metrics are based on real stress tests of the **PeroCore Rust Engine**.

> 📂 **Resources**: Find scripts and tools in the [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directory.
> 📄 **Core Report**: [Comprehensive Benchmark Report](./benchmarks/reports/PEROCORE_FULL_BENCHMARK_REPORT.md)

#### 1. ⚡ Retrieval Efficiency (Scale: 20M Nodes / 40M Edges)

| Scale | Diffusion Steps | Avg. Latency | Associated Nodes | Rating |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **20M Nodes / 40M Edges** | 5 steps | **1.13 ms** | ~1,000 | 🔥 Ultra-Fast |
| **20M Nodes / 20M Edges** | 50 steps | **830 ms** | ~50,000 | ⚡ Deep Penetration |

#### 2. 🧩 Authoritative Benchmark: HotpotQA Multi-hop Reasoning
We utilized the **HotpotQA** dataset (EMNLP 2018) to verify the KDN operator's capability in complex logical associations.

*   **Test Case**: Comparing the nationalities of directors Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood.
*   **The Challenge**: Traditional RAG can retrieve individual biographies but fails to perform the "same nationality" logical aggregation during the retrieval phase.
*   **PeroCore Performance**:
    *   **Path Discovery**: KDN automatically triggered an energy burst at the `Nationality: American` node.
    *   **Latency**: **2.92 ms** ⚡
    *   **Conclusion**: Successfully penetrated semantic islands, achieving deterministic logical causality retrieval.

#### 3. 🏁 Competitive Edge (PeroCore vs. Traditional Vector DB)

| Dimension | Traditional Vector DB (e.g., ChromaDB) | **PeroCore Cognitive Engine** | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test Scale** | 1,000,000 (1M) | **100,000,000 (100M)** | **100x Scale** |
| **Retrieval Latency** | ~50.22 ms | **2.95 ms** | **17x Faster** |
| **Inference Latency** | ~200ms (PyTorch) | **< 15ms (Rust AuraVision)** | **13x Faster** |
| **Retrieval Nature** | Semantic Similarity | **Logical Causality** | **Qualitative Shift** |
| **Resource Usage** | High CPU/RAM (Vector ops) | **Balanced (Simulated CSR, ~12GB for 100M)** | **Stable** |

#### 3. 🎯 Logical Penetration Under 100M Noise

*   **Scenario**: Injected path `Apple -> Newton -> Gravity -> Einstein -> Relativity` hidden in **100 Million** random nodes.
*   **Input**: `Apple`
| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Latency** | **2.95 ms** |
| **Precision** | Target `Relativity` ranked in **Top 5** out of 100M. |
*   **Principle**: **"Diffusion is all you need."** Energy flows only along logical chains; random noise dissipates rapidly due to entropy increase.

#### 4. 🌌 Digital Subconscious: The 15ms Lifecycle

```mermaid

    Start((Trigger)) -- T+0ms --> Retina[Desensitization]
    Retina -- "Privacy Lock" --> Aura[Intent Mapping]
    Aura -- T+5ms --> Flashback{Subconscious Flashback}
    Flashback -- "2.95ms Diffusion" --> Topology[Correction]
    Topology -- T+10ms --> Ready([Pre-monition Ready])

    style Ready fill:#00ff00,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Start fill:#fff,stroke:#333
```

- **T+0ms | Desensitization**: Screenshot captured and instantly downsampled to 64x64. Privacy is locked at the hardware level.
- **T+5ms | Intent Encoding**: AuraVision maps geometric features to a 384D intent vector.
- **T+6ms | Subconscious Flashback**: The vector hits the Rust cognitive graph. Energy diffuses through 100M nodes in **2.95ms**.
- **T+15ms | Pre-monition Ready**: Before you type a single character, relevant memories are prefetched. **AI is ready.**

<br/>

## 👁️ AuraVision: The Bionic Eyes

> **"I see you, not your secrets."**

AuraVision is a **privacy-first visual perception system**. Unlike generic models, it is custom-designed and trained for desktop context.

- **Proprietary Architecture**: A **CNN-Transformer hybrid** designed for low-res desensitized features.
- **Privacy by Design**: Input is strictly 64x64 Sobel/Canny edges. Even we cannot distinguish your text or files from the data stream.
- **Rust-Powered Inference**: Based on `tract-onnx`, achieving **< 15ms** end-to-end latency on standard CPUs.

<br/>

## ⚡ NIT Protocol 2.0

**NIT (Non-invasive Integration Tools)** is our proprietary orchestration protocol. It goes beyond simple "Function Calling" by giving AI **programmatic reasoning**.

Instead of one-off API calls, AI writes **micro-scripts** to orchestrate tasks:
- **Pipelining**: Multi-step execution without returning to LLM.
- **Async Execution**: Heavy tasks (crawling, drawing) run in background while AI continues chatting.
- **Self-Correction**: The runtime provides error feedback; AI attempts to fix and retry its own scripts like a human dev.

<br/>

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

PeroCore uses a **Python (Orchestration) + Rust (Kernel)** hybrid architecture.

- **Rust Core**: Handles vector indexing (`usearch`), graph diffusion, and atomic I/O. Exposed via `PyO3`.
- **NIT Engine**: DSL interpreter for parsing and executing `<nit>` scripts.
- **Service Mesh**: FastAPI-based microservices for ASR, TTS, and Vision.

<br/>

## 🛠️ Documentation Integrity: Yes, it's AI-assisted

If you feel this documentation looks "too much like AI" — **your intuition is correct. It is indeed AI-generated.**

As developers, we spend 99% of our time squeezing Rust performance and building KDN logic, leaving the tedious task of "translating hardcore logic into human-readable docs" to AI. However:

1.  **Authentic Logic**: While the copy is AI-generated, the architectures (CSR, PEDSA) and algorithmic logic described are fully implemented by us.
2.  **Authentic Data**: All performance metrics and benchmark results come from real [Benchmark](./benchmarks) stress tests, not AI hallucinations.
3.  **Open Source Truth**: We encourage you to read the [Rust source code](./backend/rust_core/src) or run the [scripts](./benchmarks) yourself. Let the code verify the claims.
